<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm a passionate web developer on a mission to craft intuitive and efficient digital experiences. Currently, I'm in my 3rd year pursuing a B.Sc. from the  University of Rajasthan. In parallel, I am also furthering my expertise with a B.S. in Data from IIT Madras, all while embracing the world of remote learning.</p>
<p>My journey into the world of web development has equipped me with a robust skill set that includes HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. I have also delved deep into backend technologies with Node.js and database management using SQL and PostgreSQL. Additionally, I'm proficient in React.js, ensuring dynamic and responsive web solutions. My familiarity with Git ensures seamless version control and collaborative workflows.</p>
<p>Beyond the realm of coding, I find solace in the strategic intricacies of chess, both on the board and online. My love for games doesn't end there; I enjoy a mix of outdoor and indoor sports, always cherishing the thrill of competition. When not immersed in the digital world or a game, you can often find me engrossed in a captivating book. Whether it's fiction, non-fiction, or any genre in between, I believe in the power of stories to inspire and enlighten.</p>
<p>Traveling is another passion of mine. Exploring new cultures, cuisines, and landscapes rejuvenates me, offering fresh perspectives that often find their way into my work. I believe that each journey, whether in code or across continents, shapes us in unique ways, and I'm always eager to embark on the next adventure.</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to connecting with fellow enthusiasts and collaborators in the ever-evolving world of web development!</p>
